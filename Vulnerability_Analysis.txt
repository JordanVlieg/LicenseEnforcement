There are at least two ways to trick my code into thinking you have a valid license when in fact you do not.  i.e. velnerabilities.

1)
The license keys contain both your computername and the expiry date of the license.  
If two people with the same computername were to share the licenseinfo.xml file, it would falsely list their licenses as valid.

This could be solved by having an external server ensure that no key is used by more than one computer (it would have to be contacted by the program).

2)
The program checks the license expiry date against the local computer's time.  
If a user were to change their computers current time, the license could falsely list as valid.

This could be solved by checking the expiry time against an NTP server.
